Code Counter App

It’s a Pomodoro focused task manager. Essentially it gives you the ability to plan out your projects, predict how long they will take, then measure how productive you were based on your estimations.

It’s loosely based on the “Productivity Planner”, but entirely digital. I love the system and will probably end up using this app.

What’s Under The Hood?

It’s built in the less popular Ruby framework, Sinatra. Sinatra is an interesting framework, it’s lower level. It has its moments. With less abstraction, it makes it slightly easier to follow, as more of your code is explicit. However, Rails trumps it pretty hard on many levels. 1) the community had doubled down on Rails 2) some of the Rails abstraction is freaking genius.
